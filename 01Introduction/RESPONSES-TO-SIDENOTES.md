Author: To my friends and family, sorry I’ve been so absentminded!
<br>My Response: Hopefully, you're not divorced and an alcoholic by the time I finish reading this chapter.

Author: Strangely enough, a situation I have found myself in multiple times. You wouldn’t believe how much some of them can drink.
<br>My Response: I bet they drank like a fish.

Author: Static type systems in particular require rigorous formal reasoning. Hacking on a type system has the same feel as proving a theorem in mathematics.
<br>My Response: This is why people dislike C.

Author: It turns out this is no coincidence. In the early half of last century, Haskell Curry and William Alvin Howard showed that they are two sides of the same coin: the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
<br>My Response: I thought Haskell Curry was the creator of Haskell, I am not really a history buff.

Author: A random selection of some little languages you might run into.
<br>My Response: When I was 15, I thought English and Spanish were going to be the only languages I'd be able to read.

Author: And its practitioners don’t hesitate to play up this image. Two of the seminal texts on programming languages feature a dragon and a wizard on their covers.
<br>My Response: The last console I owned was a GameCube, I don't game.

Author: Yacc is a tool that takes in a grammar file and produces a source file for a compiler, so it’s sort of like a “compiler” that outputs a compiler, which is where we get the term “compiler-compiler”.
<br>My Response: I just realised Yacc stands for Yet Another Compiler Compiler.

Author: Yacc wasn’t the first of its ilk, which is why it’s named “Yacc”—Yet Another Compiler-Compiler. A later similar tool is Bison, named as a pun on the pronunciation of Yacc like “yak”.
<br>My Response: Get a life.

Author: If you find all of these little self-references and puns charming and fun, you’ll fit right in here. If not, well, maybe the language nerd sense of humor is an acquired taste.
<br>My Response: It's not charming and fun, it's strange. 

Author: Well, some asides do, at least. Most of them are just dumb jokes and amateurish drawings.
<br>My Response: I'm glad you've realised your dumb jokes.

Author: I know a lot of language hackers whose careers are based on this. You slide a language spec under their door, wait a few months, and code and benchmark results come out.
<br>My Response: Do their husbands laugh at their dumb jokes too?

Author: Hopefully your new language doesn’t hardcode assumptions about the width of a punched card into its grammar.
<br>My Response: I'll try not to.

Author: The book uses Java and C, but readers have ported the code to many other languages. If the languages I picked aren’t your bag, take a look at those.
<br>My Response: I'm cool with Java and C, not cool with boring lectures.

Author: A compiler reads files in one language, translates them, and outputs files in another language. You can implement a compiler in any language, including the same language it compiles, a process called self-hosting.
<br>My Response: Okay.

Author: You can’t compile your compiler using itself yet, but if you have another compiler for your language written in some other language, you use that one to compile your compiler once. Now you can use the compiled version of your own compiler to compile future versions of itself, and you can discard the original one compiled from the other compiler. This is called bootstrapping, from the image of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps.
<br>My Response: Is this where decompiling was invented?

Author: I pronounce the name like “sea-locks”, but you can say it “clocks” or even “cloch”, where you pronounce the “x” like the Greeks do if it makes you happy.
<br>My Response: I know you're trying to make this fun.

Author: Did you think this was just an interpreter book? It’s a compiler book as well. Two for the price of one!
<br>My Response: I greatly appreciate your work and efforts.
